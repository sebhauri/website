I am currently finishing a master in cybersecurity at EPFL. I have completed all my compulsory courses and I am currently doing my master thesis at [LASEC](https://lasec.epfl.ch) on post-quantum anonymous tokens.

I'm passionate about cryptography, decentralized systems, cooking and everything related to privacy. I also like football, trekking and skiing.

Whenever I have time, I try to spend it in the mountains. In our field, it is really important to disconnect and take a breath of fresh air. It is in Valais, at home, that I can take this time and every time I come back, I wonder why the _Dents du Midi_ are not listed in the wonders of the world.
